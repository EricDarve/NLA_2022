<!-- bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental -->

New CG derivation by Rajat Dwaraknath.

Outline:

* Problem setup $A x^* = b$
* Compute A-orthogonal basis $p_1, \dots, p_k$
* Approximate solution by A-projecting $x^*$ onto span($p_1, \dots, p_k$)
* Choose $p_k$ such that they span Krylov sequence
* Residuals are now parallel to the $q_k$ from Lanczos
* Do Gram Schmidt in the A-inner product on $r_k$ to get $p_k$ using a two term recurrence
