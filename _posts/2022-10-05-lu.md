### Notations

Notations | Description
--- | ---
$A$ | Matrix
$n$ | Size of the matrix
$A[1: k, 1: k]$ | Top left $k \times k$ block of $A$
$a_{ij}$ | entry $(i,j)$
$a_{,j}$ | column $j$
$a_{i,}$ | row $i$
det | determinant

We consider LU factorizations where $l_{ii} = 1$.

### Existence of the LU factorization

Theorem: the LU factorization exists if, for all $1 \le k \le n-1$, we have

$$\det(A[1: k, 1: k]) \neq 0.$$

A more precise version of this result is as follows.

Theorem: the LU factorization exists if and only if one of these conditions is satisfied:

1. For all $1 \le k \le n-1$, we have $\det(A[1: k, 1: k]) \neq 0$.
2. For any $1 \le k \le n-1$, assume that the LU factorization of $A[1: k, 1: k]$ exists. If $u_{kk} = 0$, then $a_{,k}$ is a linear combination of the columns $a_{,j}$, $j < k$.

Alternate version:

{:start="2"}
2. If $A[1:k, k]$ is a linear for combination of $A[1:k, j]$, $1 \le j < k \le n-1$, then $a_{,k}$ is a linear combination of the columns $a_{,j}$, $j < k$.

For case 2, the LU factorization of the matrix $[a_{11}]$ of size 1 always exists. If $k=1$, the condition reads $a_{,1} = 0$. Moreover, column $l_{,k}$ of $L$ is not uniquely defined when $u_{kk} = 0$, and an infinite number of LU factorizations satisfy $A = LU$.

$A[1:k, k]$ is a linear for combination of $A[1:k, j]$, $1 \le j < k \le n-1$, implies that $\det(A[1: k, 1: k]) = 0$, although the converse is not true.

We also have:

Theorem: The factorization exists and is unique if and only if $\det(A[1: k, 1: k]) \neq 0$ for all $1 \le k \le n$.

When the LU factorization exists, we have

$$ \det(A) = \prod_{i=1}^n u_{ii} $$
